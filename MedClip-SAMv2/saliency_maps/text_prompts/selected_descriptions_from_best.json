  "121.png": "A brain MRI scan demonstrates a well-circumscribed, heterogeneously enhancing lesion centered in the right cerebellopontine angle, causing mass effect on the adjacent brainstem and cerebellum, consistent with an extra-axial tumor such as a vestibular schwannoma.",
  "152.png": "Axial T1-weighted MRI demonstrates a well-circumscribed, extra-axial mass in the left posterior fossa, likely representing an arachnoid cyst.",
  "13.png": "A brain MRI showing focal enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema, suggestive of a neoplastic process.",
  "2981.png": "Sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrates a heterogeneous, poorly marginated lesion with irregular enhancement involving the clivus and extending into the prepontine cistern. There is mass effect on the brainstem, with partial effacement of the adjacent fourth ventricle. The lesion exhibits heterogeneous signal intensity without clear demarcation from surrounding structures.",
  "670.png": "A brain MRI showing a focal T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, suggestive of acute ischemic change.",
  "223.png": "Single sagittal MRI image depicts a well-defined, oval-shaped lesion in the right frontal lobe. The lesion demonstrates homogeneously hyperintense signal on T1-weighted imaging relative to adjacent brain parenchyma. The margins are smooth and well-circumscribed. There is mild mass effect evidenced by adjacent sulcal effacement and displacement of surrounding brain tissue. No apparent invasion into adjacent structures or evidence of surrounding edema is noted within this image slice.",
  "457.png": "Sagittal T1-weighted post-contrast MRI image demonstrates a well-circumscribed, near-spherical, extra-axial lesion in the midline along the convexity of the frontal lobe. The lesion exhibits homogeneous enhancement and intermediate T1 signal intensity. It exerts mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma, with mild effacement of cortical sulci and inward displacement of underlying brain tissue. The lesion abuts the inner table of the skull without evidence of invasion. There is no visible surrounding edema.",
  "1248.png": "Sagittal MRI demonstrates a well-defined, oval-shaped lesion in the sellar region with mild superior extension, measuring approximately 2.5 cm. The lesion is hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging relative to surrounding brain parenchyma, with smooth margins. Anterior displacement of the pituitary stalk is noted. Compression of the optic chiasm is evident. No visible hemorrhage or calcification within the lesion."
